# Installation

```pip install -e .```

Requires: Pandas, NumPy, wget, requests, cdflib.

# Some information on the stations and arrays. 

The code will load data from the CARISMA, IMAGE, and THEMIS websites. The THEMIS website is an excellent resource as it has magnetometer data for various stations all stored in a common (fairly common) data format that's a bit easier to load. 

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. THEMIS, SPEDAS, and pySPEDAS are excellent resources for the various ground-based magnetometer arrays loaded by ```gmag```. However, data downloaded using these resources and from the THEMIS data server are not necessarily THEMIS magnetometers. Please appropriately reference and acknowledge each array whose data you use;  acknowledgements and reference for the arrays (when available) can be found below.
2. The data from THEMIS are generally in geomagnetic cooridinates, though this is not a given. To overcome this the returned Pandas DataFrame stores data by labels which where in the CDF for data loaded using the ```themis``` module. These labels will specify the coordinate system of the loaded data.
3. CARISMA and IMAGE data loaded using the ```carisma``` and ```image``` modules are roated from XYZ to HDZ. 

### Arrays

Below is a list of the arrays suported by the ```gmag``` code. Additional details for each array including the arrays webiste, terms of use, data download, map of stations, and acknowledgement are found below.

Station data can typically be downloaded from the Homepage of each array. However, a significant amount of array and station data can be readily downloaded from the [THEMIS data server](http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/data/themis/thg/l2/mag/), [THEMIS ftp server](ftp://justice.ssl.berkeley.edu), and correspondeing [CDAWeb mirror](ftp://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/themis/thg/l2/mag/) in the form of CDFs.

The [THEMIS website](http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu) is also an excellent resource for information pertaining the stations and corresponding arrays which are stored on the [THEMIS data server](http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/data/themis/thg/l2/mag/).
